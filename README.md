## Research Notes

- ed25519 curve and related vrf seem to have been proposed for x/crypto here: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/crypto/+/13798
- since then (?) curve25519 and ed25519 have made it into x/crypto: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto
- vrf seems to have been borrowed (verbatim?) in the coniks-go project: https://github.com/coniks-sys/coniks-go/tree/master/crypto/vrf

I will start from there.
